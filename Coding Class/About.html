        <h2 style="background-color: plum; font-size: large;padding-left: 15px;box-shadow: 5px 10px 8px #888888;">I am a part-time teacher who has found organizing a peaceful act since I was a little girl. My organizing journey started in 2002 by helping neighbors organize and tidy every room in their homes. Many years later, while attending Fresno State University, I was hea of the homeless department at the VA Hospital and created a system for their daily donations. After graduating with my teaching credential, I assisted other teachers by transforming their rooms into efficient work spaces. My mission is to offer my expertise to those wanting to recreate order and take power over their environment again.</h2>
